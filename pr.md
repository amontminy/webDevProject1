1. What did you like about this website?

I think the website divided content in a way that helped the audience it was serving make better decisions. The photos of the dogs were also really cute!

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's.

One difference is that in this person's site, the navigation bar stays visible at the top of the screen while the user is scrolling. There was also more variation within the structure and oragniazation of each page in the website compared to my own. Between my website and this website, I think overall my website has a better user experience. The docked naviagation bar is a feature that enhances the user experience on this website more than my own. However, I think that my website has a more consistent organization strucutre on each of the web pages that makes it easier to locate information.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?

The code is well-structured within the files. The css is refactored to limit duplication and the site uses appropriate elements in the html code. However, there is currently no directory system to organize files externally in this website. This makes it more dificult to locate and maintain the website files as a developer. One way to help improve this would be to create individual directories for the images/icons and the non-index html pages. It also might be useful to create a css directory, even though there's currently only one css file, in case there needs to be more stylesheets in the future.

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.

I didn't find any major issues with the code structure. The elements seemed to be appropriate for their purpose and the css was well organized and refactored to minimize duplication. I did notice some issues with the code as I was adjusting the screen sizes. The tabs on the naviation bar wrapped around on a smaller screen, which made them much harder to click properly. There were also some inconsistencies with spelling and grammar. While this was a small detail, it happened enough times to impact the user experience.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

Good job overall, it seems like your website meets most of the criteria for the project.
