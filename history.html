                If you want to know where our golden friends game from look
                no further! To get to where our goldens started we need to 
                head overseas to England in the early 1800's. We set our eyes
                on a Dudley Coutts Marjoribanks a dog breeder from an early age
                and a prevalent one at that. After passing by a golden dog on
                a walk one day it piqued his interest and inspired Dudley to 
                breed our golden friend into prominance. And in a rather 
                surprising story an undesirably colored hunting dog began
                its run towards capturing American hearts.
